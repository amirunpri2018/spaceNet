(1981) are stored in a list named \\code{vickers} and represent three different social relations among 29 seventh grade students, 12 boys and 17 girls, in a school in Victoria, Australia. Each student was asked if\n\\itemize{\n\\item{\\emph{Network 1}: he\\ she got on with another given student;}\n\\item{\\emph{Network 2}: he\\ she considered another given student as his\\ her best friend;}\n\\item{\\emph{Network 3}: he\\ she would have liked to work with another given student.}\n}\nThe matrix \\code{sex} is an edge-specific binary covariate concerning the gender of pairs of students. If a pair of students is of the same sex, the corresponding entry in the matrix is 0, otherwise is 1.\n}\n\n\\references{\nVickers, M. and Chan, S. (1981).
